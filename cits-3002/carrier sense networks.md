- all stations can sense teh electrical carrier before sending 
- possible because of the high speed cables over short distances 

- main attraction is carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) protocols

factors affecting CSMA lans 
- all frames are of constant length 
- no transmission errors, other than those of collisions 
- no capture effect 
- the random delay after a collision is uniformly distributed and large compared to the frames transmssion time
- frame generation attempts (Old and new) form a poisson process with mean G frames per tie 
- a station may not transmit and recieve simultaneously 
- each station can sense the transmission of other stations 
- sensing of the channel state can be performed at the same time as trnasmitting 
- the propagation delay is small compared to the frames transmission time, and identical for stations
