- why are we looking at these theoretical probability models 

- in inferential statistics we are going to 
	- take samples from a population 
	- calculate sample statistics (such as mean)
	- make deductions about the population 
- **the key concept is that the sample mean is itself a random variable with a known probability distribution**
