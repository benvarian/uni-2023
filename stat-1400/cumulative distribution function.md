- we can calculate P(1 ≤ X ≤ 2) as

	- just using the two values P(X ≤ 1) and P(X ≤ 2)
- given a pdf f, define a new function F, called the cumulative distribution function so that 
	- F(x) = P(X ≤ x)
- which is the area under the curve of f from -∞ to x

- for the track length data

	- the values of F are probabilites 

- using the CDF 
	- computer software will calcuate values of F(x), and we can use this to work out anything else
