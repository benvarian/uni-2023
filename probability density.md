- instead of dividing the "square of area one" into rectangular pieces, it has been moulded into a shape with a continuous border

- the shape of the curve is described by a function f(x)
- this function is called the probability density function, or pdf 
- the values of the pdf are not probabilities themselves 
- the pdf should be viewed as "amount of probability per unit of x"


- areas under the curve 
	- probabilites are the areas under the probability density curve

- a continuous die 
	- consider a continuous random variable X such that 
		- the outcomes can be any real number from 1 to 6 
		- the probability density function is uniform

- median 
	- the median of a continuous random variable X is the value m that divides the probability into equal halves

- mean
	- the mean or expected value of a continuous random variable X is the centre of mass of the probability 
	- if the pdf was made out of solid material, the mean is the x value at which the shape would "balance"

- mean vs median 
	- median 
		- values count according to their probability only 
	- mean 
		- values count according to their probability and value
