Many of his works contain elements of surrealism and magical realism 


## magic realism as a mode of perception 
- a mode of writing that defamiliarises our sense of what is real, burrows beneath our immediate perceptions, unlocks the 'logic of dreams and nightmares' and crafts narratives that force us to confront out secret selves

## effects on protagonist from the frog 
- socially isolated 
	- defies logic of money-making and consumerism by stolidly following the path of debt collection
- Accepts the reality of frog 
	- who praises his sensible nature, courage and sacrifice in putting brother and sister through college 
- Accepts a call to duty
	- in which he will have to fight the worm to stop a earthquake which will cause mass destruction
