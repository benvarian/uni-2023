- As a first guess, it would appear that the standard (wired) Ethernet protocol should also work for wireless networks - simply wait until the medium (airwaves) becomes clear, transmit, and then retransmit if a collision occurs.
- However, this simple approach will not work, primarily because not all nodes are within range of each other.
- consider the 2 examples

- a) 
	- A wishes to send a frame to B
	- but a cannot hear that B is busy receiving a message from C
	- if A transmits after detecting an idle medium, a collision may result near B
	- **this is called the hidden terminal or node problem**
	- c is hidden from a, but their communications can interfere 
- b)
	- b wishes to transmit to C
	- but hears that A is transmitting 
	- b incorrectly concludes that it cannot transmit to C, for fear of causing a collision
	- **this is the exposed terminal or node problem**
