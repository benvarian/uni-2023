- messages may be divided into smaller data units, termed packets, before transmission 
- these packets may traverse the network independetly until they reach the destination node 
- **this requires fragmenting or segmenting the messages into packets at the source node and then reassembling the packets into messages at the destination**
- each packets must indicate that it is part of some bigger message 
- **an important consideration for fragmentation is determining the optimal packet size**
- compared to variable sized packets, fixed size has these benefits 
	- throughout the network, each nodes buffer size may be fixed 
	- simpler to prevent congestion at a destintation node, since the destination may accurately estimate the number of buffers to pre-allocate 
	- fixed-sze packets result in simpler memory allocation schemes, typically once-only allocation can be used instead of constantly using random-sized fully dynamic allocation 
- **the main disadvantage with fixed-size packets is under-utilisation of memory when the message size slightly exceeds an integral multiple of the packet size**
