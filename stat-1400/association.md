- the realation between distance and radial velocity among extra galactic nebulae 

### the experiment 
- observed 24 nebulae 
- the recessional velocity of each nebula was estimated by its redshift (in kph)
- the distance to each nebula was estimated by its apparent luminosity (in megaparsecs = 3.09 x $10^{19}$ meters)
- then produced the above sactterplot and therenby estimated a correlation between distance and recessional velocity 

### is the universe expanding 
- the hypothesis of the investigation was that the universe is expanding 
- if the universe was expading, then the objects futher away must be moving faster

## association 
- a scatterplot dispalys the assocation between the two variables by 
	- direction 
		- positive: as x increases, y increases 
		- negative: as x increases, y decreases 
	- form 
		- is the form linear, or non-linear
	- strength 
		- how tigtly the variables move together

### quantify the association 
- the correlation coefficient is a unit free measure of the strength of a linear association, with the following properties

### example 
- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-15 at 10.28.00 am.png]]

### correlation coefficient 
- say we have paired data 
	- (x1, y1),(x2, y2),...,(xn, yn),
	- where (xi, yi) is the ith observation 
- let $s_x$ denote the sample standard deviation for the x varaible 
- let $s_y$ denote the sample standard devation for the y variable

### a strong correlation 
- there is a strong negative correlation between hours of sleep and amount of grumpiness
- in plain, the more sleep you get, the less grumpy you feel the next day

## cautionary notes about r
- correlation is only a measure of linear association 
- doesnt tell us about non-linear associatoins
- doesnt indicate a cause and effect relationship
- many corrleations occur due to lurking variables
