- sampling from a large population
	- say we are analysing a possibly large population 
		- of mice, studnets or voters 
	- it is impractical to examine them all, so we take a sample to represent the entire population 

- sampling bias 
	- sample is representative if its composition is similar to that of the entire population 
	- for example, a voter sample should have similar proportions of men/women, young/old, urban/rural as the entire population 
	- if some category of people are more likely than others to be selected for an interview, then we say these people are over-represented in the sample, and the sample is biased 

- sample random sampling 
	- to draw a simlpe random sample of size k from a population, 
	- number the units in the population 
	- randomly select k numbers (without replacement)

- systematic random sampling 
	- to draw a random sample of period m from a population 
		- order the units in any arbitrary sequence 
		- pick a starting point from 1 and m
		- count off every mth item from the starter

- cluster sampling 
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-30 at 12.32.39 pm.png]]
	- group the population into clusters 
	- treat the clusters as the sampling units, and take a systematic random sample of clusters 
	- take all the units in the selected clusters as the sample

- two stage cluster sampling 
	- group the population into clusters 
	- treat the clusters as the sampling units, and take a systematic sample of clusters 
	- within each selected cluster, take a systematic sample of the units in the cluster
