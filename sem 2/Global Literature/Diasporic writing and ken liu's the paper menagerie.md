what sort of geographical and historial perspectives lend diasporic wiriting its creative qualities, and why there is a huge appetite for this form of literature 

Diaspora
- the dispersion of any people from their original homeland
- to scatter or to spread out

## aspects of diasporic existence that encourages interesting writing 
- dilemmas of identity that come along with being a member of a diaspora 
- generational tensions but also stronger connections to the past
- **constantly aware of how another place does something**

## Diasporic literature 
- works that are written by authors who live outside their native land or that of their parents/ancestors
- such literature is preoccupied with how one can survive and thrive in what can be dangerous, inhospitable and pressures to assimilate are constant 
- there is a desire to remember but also a pressure to forget
- could be therapeutic for the author as an level of escapism 
- transnational connections, about networks of travel and family relationships 

### Diasporic Belonging 
- enables resistance to anti-black racism 


## identity dilemmas 
- american born chinese will often experience direct or indirect discrimination in their daily life. 
- at 10, he began to despise his mixed chinese american identity due to discrimination from white americans 
- cultural conflicts within his family, racial discrimination, and strong self-hatred pushed him into a dilemma about his identity that he initially tries to resolve by the rejection of his mother/motherland


## frog
- In page 95, the frog sort of goes back to the real world implications of the earthquake if nothing happens
- the world is like a great big overcoat, and it needs pockets of various shapes and sizes 
- true terror is the type that men feel towards their imagination
- each and every one of us is a being of limited duration, all of us eventually go down to defeat 

the reason frog picks him is cause he posses traits that the frog thinks is valuable in such a little task like cheering on someone in a fight. The act of supporting someone frog deems though is of great importance and he musnt compromise on. He draws on Katagiri helping his brother and sister grow up after his mum and dad died all while no thanks from said siblings. This shows the determination and persistence that he harnesses in his every day tasks like being a debt collector for a big bank.
