## Different types of algorithms
- greedy 
	- build solution bit by bit 
	- at each step make optimal choice for next bit
- dynamic 
	- recursive rules for problem, then optimise the algorithm by eliminating repeated work
- approximation 
	- return good solution but not the best one
	- operate very quickly
- gradient based search 
	- take known solutions and try to improve them

optimisation problems 
- trying to find a solution that performs well that meets a certain criteria that is set
