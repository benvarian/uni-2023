## extract from text

```
But my parents were no longer around. You know what the Chinese think is the saddest feeling in the world? It’s for a child to finally grow the desire to take care of his parents, only to realize that they were long gone.

Son, I know that you do not like your Chinese eyes, which are my eyes. I know that you do not like your Chinese hair, which is my hair. But can you understand how much joy your very existence brought to me? And can you understand how it felt when you stopped talking to me and won’t let me talk to you in Chinese? I felt I was losing everything all over again.

Why won’t you talk to me, son? The pain makes it hard to write.

### what can we talk about from the extract?
- "It’s for a child to finally grow the desire to take care of his parents, only to realize that they were long gone."
	- she was never able to care for her parents in the capcitiy that jack was 
	- parents taken away from her as they were seen as traitors as they had relatives in hong kong 
	- family tradition of realising things before its to late 
	- **interesting that she still references her past in china, even though she has travelled so far away from her homeland, and arguably lives a better life**
- "Son, I know that you do not like your Chinese eyes, which are my eyes. I know that you do not like your Chinese hair, which is my hair. But can you understand how much joy your very existence brought to me? And can you understand how it felt when you stopped talking to me and won’t let me talk to you in Chinese?"
	- she has had to experience racism in the form of her own child not wanting to embrace his own mothers tradition 
	- the reason jack had a distain for his mother and her 'nationality?' was due to the white kids saying how he looked 'unfinished' and he took real offence to that even though he was at such a young age, almost taking away the innocence of a child 
	- for a mother to lose communication with her own son because he doesn't want to communicate with her must be terrible 
- "Why won’t you talk to me, son? The pain makes it hard to write."
	- finishing off on this point is the climax of the letter and story, throughout the story we have only seen jacks mother represented to us from his point of view, making us believe that its her fault for his un-satisfaction with his heritage and looks,
		- but at the end of this letter
			- we gain insight into her life, and the hardships that she has had to persist through to get up to this point in her life 
	- we see the emotional and mental toll that his actions have taken on her, almost persuading the reader to side with the mother, as we begin to view his actions as cowardly and wimpy 
	- the trope of a coming of age has definitely been everted as instead of seeing the protagonist progress in life in a successful way, we have seen almost turn into the antagonist in a way


aim of essay 
- struggles that a person must go through when experiencing diaspora 
- the cultural struggles that are presented when trying to acclimatise to a new culture
