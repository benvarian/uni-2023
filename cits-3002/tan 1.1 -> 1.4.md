- computer network 
	- collection of internconnectd autonomous computing devices 
- two computers are said to be interconnected if they can exchange information 

## 1.1.1 access to information 
- much of the information on the internet is accessed using a client server model, where a client explicitly requests information from a server that hosts that information 
- another popular model for accessing information is the peer-to-peer model 
	- individuals who form a loose group can communicate with others in the group 
	- every person in principle can communicate with one or more other people, there is no fixed division into clients and servers 

## 1.1.2 person to person communcation 
- basically services that allow people to upload any content that allows people to connect to each other from anywhere in the world 

## 1.1.3 eletronic commerce 
- theres a space in the internt where there exists a peer to peer connection where someone can act as a seller and the other as a buyer and can facilitate online transactions with goods 

## 1.1.4 entertainment 
- tv shows now reach many homes through the use of IPTV (IP Television) systems that are based on IP technology instead of cable tv 

## 1.1.5 internet of things 
- **ubiquitous computing entails computing that is embedded in everyday life**

# 1.2 types of computer networks 

## 1.2.1 broadband access networks 
- internet access provides home users with connectivity to remote computers 

## 1.2.2 mobile and wireless access networks 
- mobile phones typically know their own locations 
- GPS (global positioning system) can directly locate a devcie, and mobile phones often also triangulate between WIFI hotspots with known locations to determine their location 
- other service may record a location, such as annotating photos and videos with the place that they where made, this practice is known as geo-tagging 

## 1.2.3 content provider networks 
- many internet services are now served from the cloud or a data center network 
- data center networks serve the increasingly growing demands of cloud computing and are designed to move large amounts of data between servers in the data center 
- many internet services need to deliver content to users around the world, to do so many sites use a CDN (content delivery network)
- a large collection of servers that are geographically distributed in such a way that content is places as close as possible to the users that are requesitng it 

## 1.2.4 transit networks 
- when the content provider and your ISP (internet service provider) are not directly connected, they often rely on a transit network to carry the traffic between them 
- transit networks are traditionally called backbone networks because they have had the role of carrying traffic between two endpoints 

## 1.2.5 enterprise networks 
- networks called VPNs (Virtual private networks) connect the individual networks at different sites into one logical network 
- in the simplest terms, one can imagine a company information system as consisting of one or more databases with company information and some number of employees who need to access them remotely 
- in this model the data is stored on servers, centrally housed and maintained by a system administrator 
- the employees have simpler machines, called clients on their desks 
- telephone calls between employees may be carried by the computer network instead of by the phone company , this technology is called IP telephony or VOIP (Voice over IP)

# 1.3 network technology from local to global 

## 1.3.1 personal area networks 
- PANs (Personal area networks) let the devices communicate over the range of a person 
- to help users with connectivity people came up with bluetooth, the idea is that if your devices have bluetooth then you dont have to deal with cables 

## 1.3.2 local area networks 
- private network that operates within an nearby single building 
- widely used to connect personal computers and consumer electronics to let them share resources 
- in most cases, each computer talks to a device called an AP (access point), wireles router or base station 
- this device relays packets between the wireless computers and also between them and the interent 
- many wired lans comprise point-to-point wired links. 
- IEEE 802.3 popularly called ethernet, is by far the most common type of wired lan

## 1.3.4 metropolitan area networks 
- covers a city 
- best known examples are cable television networks

## 1.3.5 wide area networks 
- spans a large geographicla area, country, continent or even multiple continents 
- uses transmission lines and switches to connect networks that are of great length apart 

## 1.3.6 internetworks 
- a collection of internconnected networks is called an internetwork or internet 
- the internet connects content providers, access networks, enterprise networks, home networks and many other networks to one another
