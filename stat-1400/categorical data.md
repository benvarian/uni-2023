## categorical data 
- the observations are categories rather than numerical values 
- for quantitative data, we chose bins and then assigned observations to bins and used the resulting counts for display

## displaying categorical data 
- bar chart 
	- equal width vertical bars whose height represents counts 
	- the are principle says values should be proportional to area 
	- bars should be seperated from each other 
- pie chart 
	- circle sliced into areas proportional to frequencies 
	- each seciton like a slcie of pie

## two categorical variables 
- example 
	- the fate of the passengers when the titanic sank on its maiden voyage in april 1912 
		- survival category 
			- each passenger either lived or died 
		- ticket category 
			- each passenger was either a crew member or had a first class, second calss or third class ticket 

## contingency table 
- dispalys counts for each combination of categories

- can use relative frequencies

## marginal distribution 
- the distribution of just one of the variables 
- summing the category of interest over all possible values of the other category in the contingency table 
- contained in the total row or column of the contingency table

## conditional distributions 
- distribution of one variable, subject to some conditions or constraints on the other 
- we may be interested in the survival rates but for only crew
