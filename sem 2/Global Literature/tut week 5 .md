## why is novel called annie john?
- wouldn't know if its her or her mum 
- same as mums name
- tries to break free from her mothers shadow (name)


## how do you interpret annies relationship with her mum?
- seems like they where very close 
- looked up to her mum
- saw her having sex, began to revolt her, grew distant of her 
- wanted to start her own legacy -> coming of age tropes 
- wanted to move away from home just like her mother had all that time ago
- seperate identities when she sees them having sex with the "white boney hand"
- relates to the western story "paradise lost"

**past catches up with them with the generational trauma**
