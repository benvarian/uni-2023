- a collision now occurs when a device or LAN-segment recieves two or more signals simultensously 
- the goal is to reduce collisions by either resolving them quickly or reducing the liklihood of them occuring at all 
- the diagram below shows the difference between a hub and a switch, when node F is transmitting to node C

- the hub will retransmit the frame to all of its outgoing ports, whereas the switch will more intelligently retransmit the signal to the ports known to be wanting the frame 
- a collision domain is the set of devices receiving a frame collision
