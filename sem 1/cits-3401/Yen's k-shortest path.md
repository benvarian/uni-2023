- similar to dijkstra's source target shortest path algorithm, but in addition to finding the shortest path between two nodes, it also calculates teh second shortest, third shortest 
- useful for geting alternative paths
- steps
	- first calculating the root path
	- then calculating the spur path, ie (the shortest path from the starting node to the next-to-last node in the previous shortest path) and repeating k times
