## variability 
- there are many sources of variability in data 
	- biological variability 
		- natural variation among humans 
	- measurement error 
		- measurement error is almost always present 
- need to measure quantify variability 

## common measures of variability 
- range
	- diff between max and minimum values 
- interquartile range 
	- the boundaries of the middle 50% of the observations 
- standard deviation 
	- the average deviation of the observations from the mean

## the range 
- max - min 

## sample standard deviation 
- a positive number describing the average deviation of the data form the mean 
- square root of the sample variance 

## sample variance 
- the average of the squared deviations from the mean 
- the sample variance is denoted by $s^2$  and is given by

- the sample standard deviation is the square root of the sample variance 

## divide by n or n-1
- the mean involves dividing by n
- the sample variance involved dividing by n - 1
