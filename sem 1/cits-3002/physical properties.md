- the original ethernet standard proposal was for a 3mbps network, connecting up to 256 stations

- each packet must be at least 64 bytes long to provide some reasonable chance of detecting collisions over long-ish propagation times 
- due to power losses within the ethernet cables, each segment cannot exceed 500m, so repeaters where used to connect up to 5 segments in a single lan
- fiber optic speeds and segment lengths have increased: 10GBase-ER (extended range) allows 40km. 100Gbps is in the works.
