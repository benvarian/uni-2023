- the popularity and proliferation of commodity wireless netoworks, such as wireless ethernet and bluetooth have exposed networks to new security challenges 
- the original designs of the popular IEEE 802.11b/g standards recognised these challenges. and included both encryption and authentication into the standards as early as 1996. whenever these are being considered anywhere, 3 factors emerege 
	- the need for privacy - how strong must these protocols be in terms of computational power, time and money 
	- ease of use - if too invaside or too difficult to configure security will simply be bypassed 
	- government regulations - encription products are regulated by many governments which attempts to limit the strength of exported algorithms
