- characterises the origami animals as if they are real, putting life into his mothers work
- shows the type of connection that he was able to have with such a little thing 

```c++
I could hear the skittering steps of the other animals behind in the hallway, timidly peeking into the living room.

- coming to grip with his nationality and triyng to blend in with the normal american crowd

- "looking like the water buffalo when Laohu used to pounce on himand squeeze the air of life out of him."

- her speaking embarrassed him

- continue my all american pursuit of happiness

- saying "haizi mama ai ni"  which translates to mother loves you in chinese
	- cut her off indicating that he didnt care even though it was something important -> completely detached from caring about his family in a way, said that he didnt even really know his dad

- never learned to read chinese -> showing how from a young age he never wanted to connect  with his families heritage 



## what do the menagerie and paper animals represent?
- connection to his mum
- when he began to grow distant of his mum the origami began to have less of an effect on him saw less life and couldnt play with them

## why they so important to jacks childhood
- world of imagination between his mum and him
- relationship was the origami 
- when they put the box in the attic and pushed it aside, shows him letting go of his religion from him mother


## how and to what effect, is jacks mother represented?
- outsider -> pack away her religion and adapt the american way, no one tries to help her cause of outsider, been bought from a catalogue 
- women are expected to give up a lot if the man has it better off -> especially if they asian?? can apply to all race
- 

## why is her story withheld until the ending?


## why does jacks father allow jack to distance himself from his mother?
- jack could've been a bridge between the two cultures 
- dad could've done more to bring her into the american way 
- expectation to asimilate to the culture
- "just speak english to him", "he needs to fit in"
