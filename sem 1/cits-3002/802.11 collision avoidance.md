- A further problem is that most wireless cards are unable to both transmit and receive at the same time, on the same frequency - they employ _half-duplex_ transmissions.
- This means that while collisions do occur, they generally cannot be detected (while transmitting).
- 802.11 do not employ the carrier sense multiple access with collision detection 
- instead 802.11 emlpoys collision avoidance to reduce the likelihood of collisions occuring 
- the algorithm is termed multiple access with collision avoidance (MACA) or CSMA/CS, in which both physical channel sensing and virtual sensing are employed 
- **the basic idea is that before transmitting data frames, the sender and receiver must first exchange additional control frames before the true data frames, the success or failure of this initial exchance either reserves the medium for communication between A and B, or directs how A,B and all other listening nodes should act**

- there are 2 final considerations 
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-28 at 7.33.26 pm.png]]
	- when the reciever B successfully receives a data frame , it must reply with an ACK frame. all other nodes must wait for this ACK frame before they can transmit their own RTS frames 
	- the additional ACK frames were not defined in the early MACA protocols, but added to the wireless MACA -> MACAW protocol used today 
	- what if the two nodes simultaneously issue an RTS,If they are not in range, there is little problem, we can have two transmission sequences in the same medium. If the two RTS frames collide, then any receivers will not be able to guess what they were, and no CTS frame will be issued.
	- When no CTS arrives at the senders, they _assume_ a collision and undergo the standard 802.3 _binary exponential backoff_ algorithm.
