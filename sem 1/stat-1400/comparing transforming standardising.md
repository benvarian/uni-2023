## transforming data 
- applying a function to each observation 
- if the original data is 
	- {x1, x2, ..., xn}
- and f is a function, then 
	- {f(x1), f(x2),...f(xn)}
- is the transformed data 

### why transform 
- change the units of measurement
	- f(x) = 2.54x, changes inches into centimetres 
- to symmetrise data for presentation 
- standardiese otherwise incomparable data

## the log function 
- an even more dramatic squeez is obtained by the log function 
- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-15 at 10.04.12 am.png]]
- used f(x) = log(x + 1), so that f(0) = 0

## aside: logarithms 
- consider the function f(x) = $e^x$

- e = 2.718281824 is eulers number 


## all we need to know 
- the log function grows very slowly 

## mathematical notation 
- suppose that {y1, y2, y3,...,yn} is a dataset with the mean of $\overline{y}$ and sample standard deviation s.
