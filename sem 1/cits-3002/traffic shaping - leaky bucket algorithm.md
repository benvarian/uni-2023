- consider a leaking bucket with a small holse at the bottom
- water can only leak at a fixed rate 
- water that cannot fit in the bucket will overflow and be discarded 
- Turners 1996 leaky bucket algorithm enables a fixed amount of data to leave a host per unit time. it provides a single server queueing model with a constant service time

- if packets are of fixed sizes, one packet may be transmitted per unit time 
- it packets are of variable size, a fixed number of bytes may be admitted 
- **the leaky bucket algorithm enables an application to generate bursty traffic without saturating the network**
