- simplex connectionless
	- sender sends its frames without waiting for the receiver to acknowledge them
	- no attempt is made to detect or re-transmit lost frames
	- most modern LAN tech uses this method and leave error resolution to higher layers 
- half-duplex connectionless 
	- each frame is individually acknowledged 
	- frames which are lost or garbled are retransmitted if the receiver requests them or after a suitable timeout 
- full-duplex connection oriented 
	- each frame is individually numbered and is guaranteed by the data link layer to be received once and only once and in the right order 
	- the result is that the data link layer presents a reliable frame stream to the network layer
