- we can employ two common schemes to share the medium 
- polling 
	- either the satellite or a ground station offers the channel to an individual user for a specified amount of time 
- frequency and time division multiplexing 
	- 2 significant divsion multiplexing allocation (FDMA) and time division multiplexing allocation (TDMA)
	- using FDMA the channel is divided into N frequency bands for a maximum of n users. guard bands are palced between these to limit interference 
	- using TDMA the channel is divided into slots based on time intervals, ~ 125 usec, each potential user may then use the whole channel for their time quantum 
	- both FDMA and TDMA are very inefficient since the actual number of users, M, is generally <<N or >>N, and traffic is often bursty
