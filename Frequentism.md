- frequency of a bin 
	- the number of observations in the bin 
	- a whole number value 
	- frequencies add up to the total number of observations 
- histogram

- relative frequency of a bin
	- is the value 
	- number of observations in bin / total number of observations 
	- a fraction between 0 and 1 
	- relative frequencies add up to 1

- chance or probability 
	- what is the chance that a new observation will fall into the "15-micron" bin?
	- this bin has a relative frequency of about 0.055 or 5.5%
	- you would say that the probability that an observation is in that bin is about 5.5%
