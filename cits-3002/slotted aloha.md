- the slotted aloha mechanism makes an obvious improvment to improve expected throughput 
	- the satellite generates a timing pulse 
	- users then only transmit when they get this pulse 
- this quantisation of time reduces the vulnerability period by half (now to a single packet transmission time)
- hence: S = G * $e^{-G}$ 
- max throughput is now achieved when G = 1 
	- giving S = 1 / e
- or a best utilisation of 36.79%
