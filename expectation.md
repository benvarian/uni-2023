- the expected value of a discrete random variable X with outcomes x1, ..., xn, is denoted E(X) and has the value

- using summation notation we have

- mean 
	- the expected value of a discrete random variable is the theorectical analogue of the mean of an observed data set 
	- if you where to take a real die and throw it many times, in theory the mean will be about 3.5 

- for two die

- spread 
	- for a discrete random variable, we have the analogus concept of spread as we do for observed data 
	- the variance is defined as

	- so the variance is actually the expected value of the random variable

- standard deviatoin 
	- square root of the variance
