## 1.4 examples of networks 
### 1.4.1 the internet
- the arpanet 
	- the idea of it was that all military communcations used the public telephone network. 
	- the main vulnerability of this network was that the destruction of a few key toll offices could fragment it into many isolated islands so that genreals in the pentagon could not call a base in LA. 
	- one of the first implementations very early on 
	- allowed colleges that where awarded grants by the governemt to communicate with each other over these new protocols and test them basically 
- NSFNET
	- supercomputer had a fuzzbal that used TCP/IP to communciate across different states in america 
	- connected with 56-kbps leased lines 
	- the first ever TCP/IP WAN
- Internet diagram
	- the cable network, HFC, is a single integrated infrastructure that uses a packet-based transport called DOCSIS (Data over cable service interface specification) to transmit a variety of data services. The device at home is called a cable modem, and the device at the cable headend is called the CMTS (Cable modem termination system)
	- the word modem is short for "modulator demodulator" and refers to any device that converts between digital bits and analog signals 

### 1.4.2 mobile networks 
- mobile network architecture 
	- E-UTRAN (Evolved UMTS terrestrial radio access network), communociation protocol that is used over the air between the mobile device and the celluar base station, which is now called eNodeB. UTMS (universal mobile telecommunications system).
	- the air interference is based on CDMA (Code division multiple access).
