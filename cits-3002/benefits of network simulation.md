- network simulation provides almost complete control over teaching the lower level netowkring protocols 
- many different aspects of networking can be controlled and examined on very dynamic "networks"
	- network topolgy 
	- message arrival rate 
	- message size and destination 
- real network infrastructure is static and too reliable 

## and the pitfalls 
- the choice of a simulation environment can constrain the types of practical exercises and discourage creativity 
- too much control in a simulation can overwhelm a student, practical work must be clearly specified
