- logical design vs physical design 
	- logical = conceptual organisation for the database 
		- create an abstraction for a real world process
	- physical = how is the data stored 
		- select data structures (tables, indexes, materialised views)
		- organise data structures on disk 
- three main goals for logical design 
	- simplicity 
	- expressiveness 
	- performance
