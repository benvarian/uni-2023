- wont need to derive the formula for a pdf or cdf 
- recognise which type of pdf / cdf describes a particular situation 
- use computational tools to evaluate the required possibilites 

 - the exponential distribution 
	 - one common pdf is the exponential distribution, with pdf 
		 - f(x) = $e^{-x}$ 
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-30 at 12.10.15 pm.png]]
	- for example f(x) = $e^{-2}$ = 0.1353352

- probabilities

- transforming random variables

- means 
	- so if Y is the random variable "weight of mouse in grams" and X is the random variable "weight of mouse in ounces" then 
		- Y = 28.3495X
	- if X is discrete then

- means scale 
	- if one random variable is a multiple of the other, 
		- Y = aX
	- then the means scale also

- temperature 
	- the same two researchers now measure temperatures, one in farenheit and the other in celsius 
	- so here

	- what is the relationship between E(X) and E(Y)
	- by a similar calculation 
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-30 at 12.16.16 pm.png]]
	- if there are numbers a,b such that

- what is E($X^2$)

- variance 
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-30 at 12.18.46 pm.png]]
- variance of transformed RVs 
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-30 at 12.19.30 pm.png]]
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-30 at 12.19.44 pm.png]]

- standard deviation 
	- variance is important but not very intuitive 
	- if X is a measurement in grams, then var(X) is a measurement in squared grams (g2), while sd(X) has the same units as X
