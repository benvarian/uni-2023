- the routing algoritms are the part of the network layer software that decides on which outgoing line an incoming packet should go
	- for virutal circuit the route is chosen once for each session 
	- for datagrams the route is chosen once for each packet 
- desireable properties for the routing algorithms are similar to those for the whole network layer 
	- correctness, simpicity, robustness, stability, fairness and optimality 
- in particular, robustness often distinguishes between the two main classes of routing algorithms, adaptive and non-adaptive 
- robustness is significant for two reasons 
	- oncea large netwokr is off and runnning it is difficult to change the routing algorith software 
	- network topologies often change - hosts, IMPs and lines frequently fail 
- the better a routing algorithm can cope with cahnges in topology, the more robust it is
