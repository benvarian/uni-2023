- using 1-persistent CSMA protocols, each station first senses the activity on the channel 
- if two stations A and B are waiting for C to finish, they just pause for a period, and when then sense that the channel is free, transmit with a probibility of 1
- this results in a good chance of a collision

- **the longer the propogation delay on a LAN the more collisoins there will be and then there will be worse performance**
