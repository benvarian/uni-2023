## statistical learning 
- a vast set of tools for understanding data 
- tools can be classified as supervised or unsupervised 
- supervsied statistical learning involves building a statistical model for predicting, or estimating, an output based on one or more inputs 
- linear regression is an approach for supervised statistical learnining 
- with unsupervised statistical learning, there are inputs but no supervising output, nevertheless we can learn relationships and structure from such data 

## background knowledge 
- random variables 
- populations and samples
- statistical inference based on the theorem of random variables including:
	- distributions, expectatoins and variances 
	- law of large numbers 
	- central limit theorem 
	- tests of significance and confidence intervals 

## quick review 
- random variables 
	- a quantity Y that depends on the outcome of an experiement 
	- wrtitten as a capital Y
	- two major types of random variables are "discrete" and "continuous" random variables
	- a discrete random variable has a probability mass function, pmf
	- a continuous random variable has a probability density function, pdf
	- both discrete and continuous random varibables have cumulative distribution functions
- populations and samples 
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-07 at 5.31.49 pm.png]]
	- population mean $$\mu$$
	- population variance $$\sigma^2$$
	- population median
- Distributions, expectation and variances 
	- let Y be a random variable 
	- the cumulative distributive function of Y is F(y) = P( Y ≤ y )
	- when Y is continuous, and it takes values from (-∞,∞) then 
		- it has a pdf, f(y) = d/dy x F(y)
		- the expected value is

		- the variance is

	- When Y is discrete, it takes values from the set {y1, ..., ym}
		- it has a pmf, P(Y = yj), j = 1, ... , m
		- the expected value is

		- the variance is

- Gaussian / Normal Distribution 
	- let Y be a normal ($\mu$, $\sigma^2$) random variable, it has the density 
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-07 at 5.49.51 pm.png]]
		- mean / expected value / expectation is $\mu$
		- variance is $\sigma^2$
		- standard normal distribution has $\mu$ = 0 and $\sigma^2$ = 1
- Normal density

- normal cdf

- numbers from the standard normal table 
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-07 at 5.53.26 pm.png]]
- numbers from the standard normal table 
	- qnorm(1-0.05/2,0,1), 1.959964
	- qnorm is the inverse function of cdf, known as the quantile function. here Z is a standard normal random variable 
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-07 at 5.55.23 pm.png]]
	- pnorm(1.959964,0,1), 0.975
	- pnorm is the cdf, we have 
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-07 at 5.56.38 pm.png]]
	- when we draw a standard normal random number, 95% chance that the number would be in the interval (-1.959964, 1.959964) or (-1.96, 1.96)
- in general if Y is a normal ($\mu$, $\sigma^2$) random variable 
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-07 at 5.57.55 pm.png]]
	- by tansformation $Z = \frac{Y - \mu}{\mu}$

- Law of large numbers 
	- let Y1, ... , Yn be a random sample of size n
	- all Y1, ... , Yn are independent 
	- they all have the same mean and variance 
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-07 at 6.01.11 pm.png]]
	- the average is 
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-07 at 6.02.24 pm.png]]
	- $\overline{Y}$ is a random variable and $\mu$ is a constant 
	- when n --> ∞, then $\overline{Y}$  -> $\mu$ 
- central limit theorem

	- instead you repeat the steps 2000 times so that we can plot it on a histogram
