- what is a data cube 
	- organised around a central theme 
	- such as sales 
	- allows data to be modelled and viewed in multiple dimensions 
	- metaphor for multi-dimensional data storage
	- the term hypercube is sometimes used, especially for data with more than three diemsions 
	- contructed from fact and dimension tables 
	- a lattice of cuboids

		- eg total sales, number of autos sold 
		- called facts
