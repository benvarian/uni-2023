## means 
- add up all the values and divide by the number of observations 
- in R
	- mean(elephant$Matings)
	- mean(iris$Petal.Width)

## median 
- if the values are ordered, then the median is the middle value

## mean vs median 
- if the data is symmetric, then the median and the mean are equal 
- right skewed 
	- the tail of the histogram extends to the right, so the mean is greater than the median 
- left skewed 
	- the tail of the historgram extends to the left, and the mean is less than the median 

## when to use which 
- mean is more easily influenced by outliers and so in most cases it does not really reflect a typical value

## terminology
- we need to use the mathematical terminology for summation 
- uses the greek letter sigma $\Sigma$ 
- suppose we have n observations 
	- y1, y2, yn
- then the expression

- mathematical terminology for the sum y1 -> yn
- the variable 'i' is called the index of summation
