- all ARPANET links were the same speed, and so the routing metric was just hops
- as diversity increasity other metricts were required
- in addition, the growing size of the network exposed the slow convergence of distance vector routing

- rotuers using link state routing periodically undertake 5 steps 
	- discover their neighbours network addresses (send request packets, receive reply packets)
	- measure the delay or cost to each of its neighbours (immediate delay, or queued delay)
	- construct link-stat packets containing all just learnt
	- broadcast this packet to all neighbours (use a flooding variant to ensure quick propagation)
	- compute the shortest path to each other router
