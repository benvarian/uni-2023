-  Dependent 
	- created by drawing data directly from operational, external 
	- allows all the data to be grabbed from a single data warehouse
	- offer centralisation
	- can be built in 2 different ways 
		- where a user can access both the data mart and warehouse 
		- where access is limited only to the data mart
- Independent
	- created without the use of a central data warehouse
	- has neither a relationship with the enterprise data warehouse nor with any other data mart 
	- antithetical to the motivation for building a data warehouse
		- we need a centralised store of data which can be analysed by multiple users with different interests who want widely varying information 
- Hybrid
	- takes data from data warehouses or operational systems 
		- combines input from sources apart from data warehouse
		- best suited for multilpe database environments and fast implementation turnaround for any organisation
