## ways to collect data 
- Controlled experiment 
	- conditions are controlled by the researcher 
- Observational study
	- no controlled by the researcher

## controlled experiment 
- research question
	- does passive smoking cause osteoporosis 
- Experiemental design 
	- 2 groups of rats 
	- one group is forced to breathe cigarette smoke 
	- other group breathes normal air 
	- afftrewards measure the amount of osteoporosis in each rat 
- drawing conclusions 
	- smoking is the only variable in which the rats differ
	- the smoking rats exhibit more osteoporosis 
- smoking rats 
	- in this experiment the experimental units were 
		- 20 rats of the same age, breed, sex and diet 
	- in the experiment 
		- 10 rats smoked the equivalenet of 20-per-day 
		- 10 rats breathed normal air 
	- Osteocyte size in non-smoking (left) and smoking rats
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-07 at 11.11.28 am.png]]
		- the size of esteocytes in the smoke-exposed animals was approximately one-fourth that in the control group
	- authors conclusions
		- "our results suggest that smoking may have a direct impact on bone structure and may cause osteoporosis"
		- there is a notion of causality in the conclusion: forcing rats to smoke caused a higher tendency to osteopororsis 
	- observational study 
		- impossible to do the smoking rats study with humans 
		- as a result is it necessary to do an observational study instead 
		- in an observational study, researchers observe the effect of a risk factor without trying to control those exposed to it 
		- in other words, take a sample including both smokers and non-smokers and measure the prevalence of osteporosis 
	- observational study example 
		- research question
			- what factor affect the risky of osteoporosis among pakistani women 
		- survey of 334 women older than 20
		- bone health was inspected using an ultrasound 
	- drawing conclusions 
		- suppose that the women who smoke are found to have a higher rate of osteoporosis 
		- does this prove that smoking causes osteoporosis?
		- no, becuase the two groups of women are not equivalent in every aspect 
		- eg: diet, family, history, affluence 
	- associations
		- all we can say is that there is an association between variables
		- this can be due to 
			- casual relationship
			- lurking variable 
			- coincidence
	- smoking humans 
		- the study identified risk factors associated with osteoporosis 
			- bmi
			- smoking 
			- family history 
			- poverty
	- lurking variable 
		- in this case there is a strong candidate for a lurking variable, namely poverty 
	- people of low income and/or low education are more likely to 
		- have a poor diet 
		- be overweight 
		- get insufficient exercise 
	- perhaps poverty is the root cause then 

## controlled experiment terminology 
- experimental units 
	- the people, animals or things on which the experiment is conducted 
- response 
	- quantity that represents the outcome of the experiement for each experimental unit 
- treatment 
	- one of the experimental conditions that can be assigned to an experimental unit

## smoking rats example 
- the experimental units were the 20 rats
- the treatments were "smoking" / "non-smoking"
- the response was the osteocyte size

## summary so far 
- experimental study 
	- the researcher influenced the experimental units by allocating differing treatments to them and measuring their response 
- observational study 
	- the researcher measures the relevant characteristics of the experimental units, without influencing them
		- Survey 
			- the researcher determines the values of the attributes by asking the participants 

## examples 
- experimental study 
	- fertilising four agricultural plots with four different fertilisers, planting sunflower, and measuring how well they grow 
- observational study 
	- counting the matings of the elephants 
		- Survey 
			- a market-research company seeking opinions on coffee drinking habits

## studies 
- for each type of study, there are in order to obtain a well-designed study
	- principles to adhere to and
	- pitfalls to avoid 
- mostly these are common sense in technical language 


## cofounding 
- if two treatments in the study are always given together, then we cannot separate their effects, and they are confounded

## confounding variables 
- there are many potential confounding variables 
	- winter vs spring 
	- lecturer confidence 
	- different cohort 
- so this is a nice anecdote, but not a stat result 

## design of an observatoinal study 
- population 
	- the entire group of individuals in whom we are interested 
- sample
	- the part of the population that we observe in the study 
- the goal is to make inferences about the entire population while measuring only a small fraction of the population 
- in order to make inferences about the entire population, the sample should be representative of the population as a whole 

## the four principles 
- control 
	- control the variation of extraneous factors 
- randomise 
	- random selcetion minimises effectors of unknown sources of variation 
- replicate 
	- repeated experiments and those larger treatment groups are more likely to be accurate 
- block 
	- significant,  but uncontrollable, sources of variation can be minimised through blocking
