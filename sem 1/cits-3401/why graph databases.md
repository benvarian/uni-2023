1. performance 
	- execution time is proportional only to the size of the part of the graph traversed to satisfy the query

2. flexibility 
	- graphs are naturally additive, meaning we can add new kinds of relationships, new nodes, labels and subgraphs without affecting exisiting queries 
	- excellent at combining data from across multiple domains 

3. agility 
	- graphs are schema free
	- do not adhere to the ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) principle
