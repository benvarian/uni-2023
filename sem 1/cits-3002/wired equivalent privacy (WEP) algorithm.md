- **The Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) algorithm is used to protect wireless communication from eavesdropping and to prevent unauthorized access to a wireless network.**
- relises on a secret key that is shared between a mobile station  and an access point 
- the secret key is used to encrypt packets before transmission, and an integrity check is used to detect frame modification in transit
- WEP was selected to meet the following criteria 
	- use is optional for the correct running of a wireless network 
	- must provide "reasonsably strong" encryption 
	- must be self-synchronising, as nodes may move in and out of range 
	- must be computationally efficient, as the encryption must be performed frequently on "slow" CPUs with limited power supplies 
	- being within us gov encryption regulations
