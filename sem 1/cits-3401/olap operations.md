- typical olap operations 
	- roll up: summarise data
	- drill down: reverse of roll-up
	- slice and dice
	- pivot (rotate)
	- other operations 
		- drill across 
			- involving multiple fact tables 
		- drill through 
			- through the bottom level of the cube to its back-end relational tables 
- data cube queries 
	- cross tabulation 
		- cross tab for short 
		- report data grouped by 2 dimensions 
		- aggregate across other dimensions 
		- include subtotals 
	- operations on a cross-tab 
		- roll up (further aggregation)
		- drill down (less aggregation)
- roll up and drill down

- slice and dice 
	- slice 
		- to pick a rectangular subset of a cube by choosing a single value for one of its dimensions, creating a new cube with one fewer dimension
	- dice 
		- produces a subcube by allowing the analyst to pick specific values of multiple dimensions

- drill across example 
	- question  
		- how did sales diverge from forecasted sales in sep 19
		- drill across between forecast and sales 
	- step 1
		- query forecast fact 
			- group by brand name, district name 
			- filter on monthandyear='sep 19'
			- calculate SUM(forecastAmt)
			- query result has schema (brand name, district name, forecastAmt)
	- step 2
		- query sales fact 
			- group by brand name, district name 
			- filter on monthandyear = 'sept 19'
			- calculate sum(totalsalesAmt)
			- query result has schema 
	- step 3 
		- combine query results 
			- join res 1 and res 2 on brand name and district name
